Objective of the Global Temperature Analysis and Prediction Project:
The primary goal of this project is to analyze historical global temperature data, identify trends, and forecast future temperature anomalies using machine learning models. Specifically, it aims to:

Analyze Global Temperature Trends:
Explore and visualize long-term trends in global temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2024, focusing on:

Seasonal variations.
Yearly and decadal trends.
Anomalies and extreme changes.

Predict Future Temperature Anomalies:
Build a predictive model to forecast future temperature anomalies based on historical data, helping understand potential future changes in global climate patterns.

Raise Climate Awareness:
Use the findings to inform users about historical temperature changes and potential future scenarios, emphasizing the importance of climate action.
